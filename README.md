# RIPIE6

## What is it...
_(An obituary notice)_

RIPIE6 is the obituary notice of Internet Explorer 6’s death. It’s a message for all users who still use that "browser". RIPIE6 is designed exactly for those old-fashioned people who don’t see the point of updating their software.

## What it’s not...
_(Another campaign)_

RIPIE6 is not another nail in the coffin of Internet Explorer 6. It is not a new campaign for killing IE6, because It’s already dead. RIPIE6 is not intended for web developers and it’s certainly not a cure for Internet Explorer 6.

## What to do...
_(Just spread it out!)_

We, developers, know that Internet Explorer 6 was born dead. But there are people out there who don’t realize that. And we, my friends, beg to inform those deluded men that IE6 has passed out. They probably think they don’t need to know that. However, we as web developers of 21st century **DO NEED THEM TO KNOW THAT**.
